## Creating your own theme
Chorus supports custom themes. If you want to create your own, create a folder into chorus/themes named as your theme's name.   
In this folder, you have to create the following files:
* **{name}.css**, to style the main view;    
* **{name}-highlight.css** to style keywords;    
* **{name}-settings.css** to style setting view;    

_Note: {name} must be the same as your folder's name._

To see the structure of a style file, take a look at this theme:   
* [Main](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/blob/master/src/assets/styles/light.css)       
* [Highlight](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/blob/master/src/assets/styles/light-highlight.css)    
* [Settings](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/blob/master/src/assets/styles/light-settings.css)

If you want to make it public, you can add it to the official [themes repository](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus-themes) following [these](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus-themes/blob/master/README.md) guidelines.
