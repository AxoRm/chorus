#### What is Chorus?
Chorus is an easy-to-use and lightweight [YAML](http://yaml.org/) editor, created for owners of Minecraft servers based on [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org).

### Why Chorus?
Before Chorus, basic YAML editors have been used; now, with Chorus, you can have a full support for configurations. You'll love it!
